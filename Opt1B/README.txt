Assignment1B -- SSAT Algorithm

The program in ssat.cpp reads in .ssat files as generated by SM's SSAT generator .cc program.
The SSAT problem will then be run through an SSAT-Solver algorithm based on DPLL. 

This program can be compiled with the command:

g++ -std=c++11 ssat.cpp -o ssat

The program can then be run with the following options:

./ssat [solution type] [filename]

Solution Type options:
	n -- Naive, where variables are selected by default order and no other statistics are performed

	u -- Unit clauses, where variables are selected by default order except when a 
		clause of length one forces the assignment of a variable

	p -- Pure variables, where variabels are selected by default 
		order except when a variable only appears in a single assignment form

	b -- Both, where variables are selected by default order except when (first) they appear
		 in a unit clause or (second) they appear as a pure variable

	1 -- Splitting Heuristic One, where, in addition to [b] above, variables are
		 selected by finding the variable in the current block that is
		 contained in the smallest clause

	2 -- Splitting Heuristic Two, where, in additon to [b] above,
		 variables are selected from the given block based on the highest number
		 of raw appearances in any unsatisfied clause

	3 -- Splitting Heuristic Three, where, in addition to [b] above,
		 variables are selected based on the number of active appearances
		 in clauses in a single state times a factor of their probability of 
		 assignment to that state

Filename:
	This file should be of appropriate .SSAT format from SM's ssat.cc. This program reads in only variable 
	and clause information, and does not read in any other solution or timing statistics (as helpful as that would have been!)
